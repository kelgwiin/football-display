 
## Football Display

We're building a football app that notifies viewers about the information such as current goals, penalties, remaining time.
 
 We're gonna do two displays LiveDisplay and TotalDisplay. MatchData has all the data (goals, penalties etc.) and with every data changes the displays should be notified.
 
 Requirements
 * Use Observer Design Pattern
 * Do not use Java Observable and Observer (do it from scratch).
 
 Note:
 You could take a look the book _Head First Design Patterns
